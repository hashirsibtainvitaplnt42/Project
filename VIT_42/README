Water Level monitor
Aims:
1 To design and develop a prototype to monitor water level in a dam and alert authorities if
  the water is above certain threshold locally by sounding an alarm and displaying warning in bold font on a screen
  and remotely with the aid of an IoT data analytics platform
Result:
1 The created prototype monitors water level and displays it on an oled screen as well as sends the readings to an IoT data
  analytics platorm ThingSpeak in realtime. If the water is above a certain threshold, the system sounds a buzzer, displays
  a warning on the oled display in bold letters and the IoT dashboard also warns the user. Thus, the project achieves its goals.
